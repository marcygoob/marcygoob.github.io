<p>The Whitney website has a separate site for kids with an interactive quality on the side, in which anyone can change the colors and patterns and then it exists on the actual site until someone else changes it.</p>

<p>"JAM with Chrome" is a really cool interactive site in which you can choose different instruments to play around with. You can click on the instruments to play different notes, or you can use the keyboard. I feel like it is another way to take people away from physical objects by replacing them with digital ones, but I'm sure that musical people wouldn't give up their real guitars for these fake ones! </p>

        <p>I love the unique chaos of this site. It seems unorganized, but it is actually really organized. It just does not have the typical structure of the average website. The images are constatnly moving, the nav is easy to find hiding on the side, and you can move up, down, left, and right around the page to find more videos, or just more colorful hexagons!</p>

        <p>Normally I don't really go for the paralax sites because when they first came out they were super cool, but now it just seems like every single site is a paralax! And I'm tired of getting my information from scrolling! But sometimes, I can't resist the cool animations that happen, and on this website, the effects make sense for the content. The bikes and environments change for a really great site! Waitta go Cyclemon!</p>

        <p>This is an amazing interactive experience, in which while you read the news article, you actually get to experience the content through motion. The motion happens by scrolling, and it makes for a great futuristic endeavor. </p>

        <p>Abstract portfolio site that features an awesome running bunning before you enter the site. TBH, that's what really brought me in!</p>
