<p>The Whitney website has a separate site for kids with an interactive quality on the side, in which anyone can change the colors and patterns and then it exists on the actual site until someone else changes it.</p>

<p>"JAM with Chrome" is a really cool interactive site in which you can choose different instruments to play around with. You can click on the instruments to play different notes, or you can use the keyboard. I feel like it is another way to take people away from physical objects by replacing them with digital ones, but I'm sure that musical people wouldn't give up their real guitars for these fake ones! </p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post3/image3.png"> 

        <p>I love the unique chaos of this site. It seems unorganized, but it is actually really organized. It just does not have the typical structure of the average website. The images are constatnly moving, the nav is easy to find hiding on the side, and you can move up, down, left, and right around the page to find more videos, or just more colorful hexagons!</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post4/3.png"> 

        <p>Normally I don't really go for the paralax sites because when they first came out they were super cool, but now it just seems like every single site is a paralax! And I'm tired of getting my information from scrolling! But sometimes, I can't resist the cool animations that happen, and on this website, the effects make sense for the content. The bikes and environments change for a really great site! Waitta go Cyclemon!</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post5/3.png"> 

        <p>This is an amazing interactive experience, in which while you read the news article, you actually get to experience the content through motion. The motion happens by scrolling, and it makes for a great futuristic endeavor. </p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post6/3.png"> 

        <p>Abstract portfolio site that features an awesome running bunning before you enter the site. TBH, that's what really brought me in!</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post7/3.png"> 

        <p>I was online shopping at Zara the other day, and I really appreciate the layout of their results. They immediately display all of the images, so you don't need to go through pages or click "view all," and the images are in two coloumns, but sometimes they will have one larger image that stretches between the two columns. I think it is a really smart solution for a shopping website.</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post8/3.png"> 

        <p>I'm really interested in these experimental websites, and my mind is boggled about how it is created. It is a great way to show people that the internet is an amazing platform to showcase how the art can be manipulated in the digital world.</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post9/3.png"> 

        <p>Another experimental website that showcases a combination of web design and motion graphics. I love how this site animates without any interaction from the user.</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post10/3.png"> 

        <p>Keezy is the inspiration for my website gurlworld.io. I want to figure out how to model my Vimeo videos and overlay my colors on top of them. I essentially want to copy this exact website :O</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post11/3.png"> 

        <p>I am obsessed with Opening Ceremony's website. Not only are their clothes the most amazing pieces of wearable fashion I've ever seen, but their website matches their style and brings back a nostaligic feeling. I definitely want to make a more experimental portfolio website in the future that mimics this style.</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post12/3.png"> 

        <p>A friend I met studying abroad made this website with two of his friends in Switzerland. It's an amazing website that showcases digital art in a very new-age kind of way that makes my heart melt.</p>

        <img style="width: 30%" src="post13/3.png"> 

        <p>I met my design twins in Israel. Two girls made a funny flash game for their senior projects. It was basically like an interactive music video for their friends' band Sodabeat. You can click around and play and listen to the music and watch all of the magical graphics happen!</p>

        <p>This was one of my inspirational sites for gurlworld. I like how it is just a quiz, and it is always up and running. It's definitely not nearly as pretty as gurlworld!!!!!</p>
