<p>The Whitney website has a separate site for kids with an interactive quality on the side, in which anyone can change the colors and patterns and then it exists on the actual site until someone else changes it.</p>

<p>"JAM with Chrome" is a really cool interactive site in which you can choose different instruments to play around with. You can click on the instruments to play different notes, or you can use the keyboard. I feel like it is another way to take people away from physical objects by replacing them with digital ones, but I'm sure that musical people wouldn't give up their real guitars for these fake ones! </p>

        <p>I love the unique chaos of this site. It seems unorganized, but it is actually really organized. It just does not have the typical structure of the average website. The images are constatnly moving, the nav is easy to find hiding on the side, and you can move up, down, left, and right around the page to find more videos, or just more colorful hexagons!</p>
