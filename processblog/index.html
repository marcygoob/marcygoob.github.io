<b>Creative Brief:</b><br><br>
For my redesign of the Enoch Pratt
Libary website, I want to make all of
the information accessible and clear.
My audience is primarily people who
actually go to the library and the age
range is technically wide, but I will focus
on more of the tech savvy individuals
in their 20s and 30s. My audience likes
to hang out in the library, where they
work on paper, laptops, or on the library
computers. They like to check out books,
movies, and music, and use resources
for research.
The website looks like it hasn’t been
redesigned in at least ten years, and
looks like it is meant for children. The
catalogue, hours, and locations are very
important parts of the site that need to
be highlighted. The catalogue needs to
be less cluttered, and there needs to
be an opportunity for people to create
an account. Once people have accounts
on the site, they can find other books to
check out, get suggestions from other
readers, find the references from books
they have already read, etc.
The site needs to include everything
that the library has to offer including
music, movies, books, and now ebooks.
It is clear on their site now that they
have ebooks, but they need to be more
accessible and treated as library books.
This means “checking it out,” and
another user can’t download it until the
other person “returns” it.
The final part of my project will be the
responsive mobile and tablet elements,
which will allow users to access hours,
maps, fees, and renewals on less clunky
devices. They can also access the other
information, like the search catalogue
and read their ebooks when they are
on the go.

<p>Time to start thinking about the design! I am trying to focus on the simplicity of the site, so it is clear and easy for the audience to use. Colors will be <span style="background-color: black; color: black; padding-right: 5px; padding-left: 5px">blue</span>,<span style="background-color: #00CCFF; color: #00CCFF; padding-right: 5px; padding-left: 5px">blue</span>, and <span style="background-color: black; color: white; padding-right: 5px; padding-left: 5px">white</span>. I also completed the Page Description Diagrams for 6 pages ande made my style tile!</p>
